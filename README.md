# AppFog for Windows Phone 7

AppFog app for Windows Phone 7, using the MVVM pattern and MVVM Light, Json.NET, and Async CTP libraries. Returns account information.

## Test Account

The AppFog token currently present in the respective text field is linked to a test account I created. Feel free to use it, as typing a whole token with a touch screen keyboard is pretty tedious!

## Issues

Authentication is based upon the token found in the ~/.af_token file due to API limitations.
